# Welcome to my website!
After a 35-year career as a NOAA Meteorologist and IT System Administrator, I'm now channeling my lifelong passion for weather data and technology into retirement projects. I love tinkering with code and data, and my work as a self-taught data scientist and full-stack programmer is what makes my ideas a reality.

On this site, I'll be sharing what I'm building, from the technical details of my homelab setup to my latest experiments in AI and machine learning for weather prediction. My focus is on creating models that go beyond traditional forecasts to a more impactful, risk-based approachâ€”the kind of information that helps people make better decisions when severe weather threatens.

I hope you enjoy it!
