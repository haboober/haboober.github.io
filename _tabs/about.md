 After a 35-year career as a NOAA Meteorologist and IT System Administrator, I'm now channeling my lifelong passion for weather data and technology into retirement projects. I love tinkering with code and data, and my work as a self-taught data scientist and full-stack programmer is what makes my ideas a reality.

On this site, I'll be sharing what I'm building, from the technical details of my homelab setup to my latest experiments in AI and machine learning for weather prediction. My focus is on creating models that go beyond traditional forecasts to a more impactful, risk-based approach—the kind of information that helps people make better decisions when severe weather threatens.

I hope you enjoy it!

# Past projects and applied research   
## NWP modeling and post processing
### 1. One-dimensional Cloud Model 
- **Title:** Potential Use of a One-dimensional Numerical Cloud Model at a Weather Service Office.
- **Authors:** Jeffrey T. Davis
- **Summary:** Describes a computer program and one-dimensional cloud model designed for the use of improving the accuracy of  thunderstorm forecasts, especially for hailstone size.
- **Date:** 1991
- **Link:** [Paper](/papers/1991-1DCU-Model.pdf)

### 2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Linear Regression for the prediction of the Vertically Integrated Liquid Water (VIL) associated with the maximum hailstome size for the day. 
- **Title:** Neural Network versus Multiple regression: Methods of estimating VIL thresholds for severe hail based on storm environment.
- **Authors:** Jeffrey T. Davis
- **Summary:** Compares the accuracy of a Neural Network (ANN) versus Linear Regression (LR) model for the prediction of VIL to the maximum hailstone size. Used operationally as a first-guess threshold of VIL values in initial warnings of severe thunderstorms with hail.
- **Date:** 1992
- **White Paper:** [Paper](/papers/1992-VILpredictionUsingNeuralNetwork.pdf)

### 3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the Calibration of Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts
- **Title:** SREF Heavy Precipitation Time Composite Situational Awareness Product (SAP)
- **Authors:** Jeffrey T. Davis
- **Summary:** Experimental NOAA/NWS Product For Heavy Precipitation Forecasts by NOAA's Short Range Ensemble Forecast System (SREF) and Situational Awareness. The product was derived from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that was used to calibrate the Probability of Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (PQPF) from the SREF.
- **Date:** 2009-2012
- **Link:** [Paper](/papers/SREF-EXP_SAP.pdf)
- **Companion Presentation:** [Paper](/papers/PQPF.pdf)

### 4. Downscaling and Bias/Error Correction of the NOAA SREF/GEFS Ensemble Forecast Systems. Operational Applications for Arizona
- **Title:** Operational Downscaling and Bias-Correction of NOAA's SREF/GEFS Ensembles using a real-time 3DVAR system (ARPS 3DVAR) as ground-truth.
- **Developers:** Lee Carlaw (Lead Developer) and Jeffrey T. Davis (Developer and Project Manager) 
- **Summary:** Local operational system to aid weather forecasters and the agriculture community in Arizona. The system uses a real-time 3DVAR analysis to downscale and bias-correct the NOAA SREF/GEFS ensemble forecast systems. The USDA/NASS CropScape product is combined with the ensemble predictions, especially for the probability of freezing temperatures, to provide precision risk forecasts for agriculture.
- **Date:** 2015-2018
- **Campanion White Paper:** [paper](/papers/IDSS.pdf)
